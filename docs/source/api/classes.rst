.. py:currentmodule:: pgpy

:py:class:`PGPKey`
------------------

.. autoclass:: PGPKey
    :members:

    .. py:attribute:: ascii_headers
        :annotation:

        An :py:obj:`~collections.OrderedDict` of headers that appear, in order, in the ASCII-armored form of this object.

    .. py:classmethod:: from_file(filename)

        Create a new :py:obj:`PGPKey` object, with contents loaded from a file. May be binary or ASCII armored.

        :param filename: The path to the file to load.
        :type filename: ``str``
        :raises: :py:exc:`ValueError` if a properly formed PGP block was not found in the file at ``filename``
        :raises: :py:exc:`~exceptions.PGPError` if de-armoring or parsing failed
        :returns: A two element ``tuple`` of :py:obj:`PGPKey`, :py:obj:`~collections.OrderedDict`.
                  The :py:obj:`~collections.OrderedDict` has the following format::

                    key, others = PGPKey.from_file('path/to/keyfile')
                    # others: { (Fingerprint, bool(key.is_public)): PGPKey }

    .. py:classmethod:: from_blob(blob)

        Create a new :py:obj:`PGPKey` object, with contents loaded from a blob. May be binary or ASCII armored.

        :param blob: The data to load.
        :type blob: ``str``, ``bytes``, ``unicode``, ``bytearray``
        :raises: :py:exc:`TypeError` if blob is not in the expected types above
        :raises: :py:exc:`ValueError` if a properly formed PGP block was not found in ``blob``
        :raises: :py:exc:`~exceptions.PGPError` if de-armoring or parsing failed
        :returns: A two element ``tuple`` of :py:obj:`PGPKey`, :py:obj:`~collections.OrderedDict`.
                  The :py:obj:`~collections.OrderedDict` has the following format::

                    key, others = PGPKey.from_file('path/to/keyfile')
                    # others: { (Fingerprint, bool(key.is_public)): PGPKey }

:py:class:`PGPKeyring`
----------------------

.. autoclass:: PGPKeyring()
    :members:

    .. py:attribute:: ascii_headers

        An :py:obj:`~collections.OrderedDict` of headers that appear, in order, in the ASCII-armored form of this object.


:py:class:`PGPMessage`
----------------------

.. autoclass:: PGPMessage
    :members:

    .. py:attribute:: ascii_headers

        An :py:obj:`~collections.OrderedDict` of headers that appear, in order, in the ASCII-armored form of this object.

    .. py:classmethod:: from_file(filename)

        Create a new :py:obj:`PGPMessage` object, with contents loaded from a file. May be binary or ASCII armored.

        :param filename: The path to the file to load.
        :type filename: ``str``
        :raises: :py:exc:`ValueError` if a properly formed PGP block was not found in the file at ``filename``
        :raises: :py:exc:`~exceptions.PGPError` if de-armoring or parsing failed
        :returns: :py:obj:`PGPMessage`

    .. py:classmethod:: from_blob(blob)

        Create a new :py:obj:`PGPMessage` object, with contents loaded from a blob. May be binary or ASCII armored.

        :param blob: The data to load.
        :type blob: ``str``, ``bytes``, ``unicode``, ``bytearray``
        :raises: :py:exc:`TypeError` if blob is not in the expected types above
        :raises: :py:exc:`ValueError` if a properly formed PGP block was not found in ``blob``
        :raises: :py:exc:`~exceptions.PGPError` if de-armoring or parsing failed
        :returns: :py:obj:`PGPMessage`

    .. py:attribute:: message
        Get the original message of the PGPMessage. If it's compressed than decompress it. The message must be decrypted. Removes any headers.

    .. py:attribute:: ascii_headers

        An :py:obj:`~collections.OrderedDict` of headers that appear, in order, in the ASCII-armored form of this object.

    .. py:classmethod:: from_file(filename)

        Create a new :py:obj:`PGPSignature` object, with contents loaded from a file. May be binary or ASCII armored.

        :param filename: The path to the file to load.
        :type filename: ``str``
        :raises: :py:exc:`ValueError` if a properly formed PGP block was not found in the file at ``filename``
        :raises: :py:exc:`~exceptions.PGPError` if de-armoring or parsing failed

    .. py:classmethod:: from_blob(blob)

        Create a new :py:obj:`PGPSignature` object, with contents loaded from a blob. May be binary or ASCII armored.

        :param blob: The data to load.
        :type blob: ``str``, ``bytes``, ``unicode``, ``bytearray``
        :raises: :py:exc:`TypeError` if blob is not in the expected types above
        :raises: :py:exc:`ValueError` if a properly formed PGP block was not found in ``blob``
        :raises: :py:exc:`~exceptions.PGPError` if de-armoring or parsing failed

Other Objects
=============

.. py:currentmodule:: pgpy.types
