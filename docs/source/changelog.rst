v0.7.0
======

(not yet released)

Dependency changes
------------------

pyasn1 is no longer needed

Now depends transitively (via the cryptography module) on OpenSSL
1.1.1 or later for Brainpool, X25519, Ed25519.

API additions
-------------

PGPSignatures represents a detached signature, which can contain more
than a single signature.  It is a simple sequence of individual
PGPSignature objects.

API changes
-----------

Armorable.is_ascii() is deprecated.  You probably want
Armorable.is_utf8() instead, since OpenPGP assumes that all text is
UTF-8.

EllipticCurveOID.Invalid was removed -- EllipticCurveOID only
enumerates supported curves now.

HashAlgorithm.hasher now returns a
cryptography.hazmat.primitives.hashes.Hash object, not a hashlib.HASH
object.  The main difference between these interfaces is the use of
finalize() instead of digest().

New Features
------------
* added the ability to ignore usage flags

Bugs Fixed
----------

v0.5.4
======

Released: April 16, 2021

======

Released: August 1, 2019

v0.4.3
======

Released: August 16, 2017

v0.4.2
======

Released: August 9, 2017

New Features
------------

 * Packets with partial body lengths can now be parsed. For now, these packets are converted to have definite lengths instead. (#95) (#208)

Bugs Fixed

New Features
------------
 * Added support for Brainpool Standard curves for users who have OpenSSL 1.0.2 available

v0.4.0
======

Released: April 21, 2016

Bugs Fixed
----------
 * Armorable.from_blob was incorrectly not accepting bytes objects; this has been fixed (#140)
 * Fixed an issue where string-formatting PGPUID objects would sometimes raise an exception (#142)
 * Occasionally, the ASN.1 encoding of DSA signatures was being built in a way that although GPG could parse and verify them,
   it was incorrect, and PGPy incorrectly failed to verify them. (#143)
 * Fixed an issue where keys with expiration dates set would have the wrong value returned from the ``key.is_expired`` property (#151)
 * Fixed an issue where PGPy would try to incorrectly coerce non-ASCII-compatible characters to ASCII-compatible bytes, potentially resulting in mojibake. (#154)

New Features
------------

 * Keys can be generated with the following algorithms:

   - RSA

 * Updated library dependencies where required or useful
 * Reworked some IO-intensive routines to be less IO-intensive, and therefore faster

======

Released: November 19, 2014

PGPy v0.3.0 is a major feature release.

.. warning::

Bugs Fixed
----------
 * When keys are exported, any certification signatures that are marked as being non-exportable are now skipped (#101)
 * When the wrong key is used to validate a signature, the error message in the raised exception

v0.2.3
======

Released: July 31, 2014

PGPy v0.2.3 is a bugfix release

Bugs Fixed
----------
 * Fixed an issue where explicitly selecting a key and then trying to validate with it would erroneously raise an exception as though the wrong key were selected.

v0.2.2
======

Released: July 31, 2014

PGPy v0.2.2 is primarily a bugfix release.

Bugs Fixed
----------
 * Fixed a typo that would cause TypeError to be raised as bytecode was being generated (#85)
 * Fixed an issue where unicode input on Python 2.7 could result in unexpected UnicodeDecodeError exceptions being raised

New Features
------------
 * Switched the main parse loop to use a bytearray instead of slicing a bytes, resulting in a ~160x speedup in parsing large blocks of passing. (#87)

v0.2.1
======

Released: July 31, 2014

PGPy v0.2.1 is primarily a bugfix release.

Bugs Fixed
----------

 * Critical bit on signature subpackets was being ignored, and when set, causing a ValueError to be raised when trying to parse it.
   The critical bit is now being parsed and masked out correctly. (#81)
 * No longer raises exceptions on unrecognized subpackets; instead, it now treats them as opaque.
 * No longer raises exceptions on unrecognized packets; instead, it now treats them as opaque.
   This also applies to signature and key packets with versions other than v4.
 * Fixed an issue where a User ID packet that lacked both a comment and an email address was failing to be found by the uid regex in KeyCollection.
 * Fixed an issue where an old-format packet header with a length_type set longer than needed was resulting in the packet getting truncated.
 * Fixed an issue where parsing a subpacket with a 2-byte length was erroneously being parsed as a 5-byte length.
 * Fixed an issue where parsing a subpacket with a 5-byte length where the value was < 8434 was causing an error
 * Fixed an issue where a packet or subpacket reporting a value marked reserved in RFC 4880 would cause ValueError to be raised during parsing.
 * Key material marked as public key algorithm 20 (Reserved - Formerly ElGamal Encrypt or Sign) is now parsed as ElGamal key material.
 * Fixed an issue where parsing a new-format packet header length where the first octet was 223 was erroneously reported as being malformed.

New Features
------------
 * Added support for parsing the 'Preferred Key Server' signature subpacket
 * Added support for loading unsupported or unrecognized signature subpackets.
 * Added support for loading unsupported or unrecognized packets.
